# Measuring Extremely Low Noise Sources

This information relates to tools and techniques related to measuring low noise sources.  Of course 
this is useful in most any discipline where low noise needs to be quantified, but the origin of the 
study in my case is low noise audio amplifiers.  Case in point is [Lilienfeld's Choir](http://auteuraudio.com/lilienfelds-choir) 
that I market under the [Auteur Audio](http://auteuraudio.com/), which exhibits a full wideband
unweighted noise level of about 1.7 uVRMS into 33 ohms inclusive of spurious 60 Hertz measurement
pickup not related to the noise of the amplifier (lead pickup).

If you look at the spectral graph, particularly in the lower frequency range, say from 100 to 500 Hertz
(discounting the 180 Hertz power line harmonic), you will note that the actual noise density is 
quite low, nearly -150dBV.  This equates to a better than -120dBV wideband audio performance, which
is pretty good.  Pretty good in part because this figure equates to >120dB SNR for typical listening 
levels (rather than maximum output, which is often the improbable output level typically reported).  This means
that we can use this amplifier to enjoy 24 bit audio at normal listening levels and actually be able to 
resolve the full depth.  A good homework exercise would be to list for yourself the converters that actually 
best this amplifier.  

One big question tends to be "how can I measure my amplifier's performance as well or better than the high 
end [Audio Precision](https://www.ap.com/) gear for the quantities that I feel are most relevant for my 
amplifier, and how can I do this at home one the cheap ."  That is what this document attempts to discuss.
