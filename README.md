# Measuring Extremely Low Noise Sources

This information relates to tools and techniques related to measuring low noise sources.  Of course 
this is useful in most any discipline where low noise needs to be quantified, but the origin of the 
study in my case is low noise audio amplifiers.  Case in point is [Lilienfeld's Choir](http://auteuraudio.com/lilienfelds-choir) 
that I market under the [Auteur Audio](http://auteuraudio.com/), which exhibits a full wideband
unweighted noise level of 1.725 microvolts RMS into 33 ohms inclusive of spurious 60 Hertz measurement
pickup not related to the noise of the amplifier.
