# Measuring Extremely Low Noise Sources

This information relates to tools and techniques related to measuring low noise sources.  Of course 
this is useful in most any discipline where low noise needs to be quantified, but the origin of the 
study in my case is low noise audio amplifiers.  Case in point is [Lilienfeld's Choir](http://auteuraudio.com/lilienfelds-choir) 
that I market under the [Auteur Audio](http://auteuraudio.com/), which exhibits a full wideband
unweighted noise level of about 1.7 uVRMS into 33 ohms inclusive of spurious 60 Hertz measurement
pickup not related to the noise of the amplifier.

If you look at the spectral graph, particularly in the lower frequency range, say from 100 to 500 Hertz
(discounting the 180 Hertz power line harmonic), you will note that the actual noise density is 
quite low, nearly -150dBV.  This equates to a better than -120dBV wideband audio performance, which
is pretty good.  The question tends to be "how can I measure my amplifier's performance as well or 
better than the high end [Audio Precision](https://www.ap.com/) gear for the quantities that I feel 
are most relevant for my amplifier."  That is what this document attempts to discuss.
